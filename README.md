## Introduction

*AzerothCore* is an open source game-server application for World of Warcraft, currently supporting the 3.3.5a game version.
It is written in C++ and based on *MaNGOS*, *TrinityCore* and *SunwellCore*.
It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.

For more information about the project, visit our website at project [AzerothCore](http://www.azerothcore.org/)


## Why AzerothCore?

Our main goal is to create a playable game server, offering a fully working game experience. In short, we focus on the **user experience (UX)**.

Like MaNGOS and TrinityCore did in past, we like to write clean code and doing software development right, but **our main goal is to have fully working features**. In other terms, we always prefer proper solutions to problems, but we may accept "*hackfixes*" (when they do not affect the game stability) if a proper solution is not available yet.

We also believe in [software modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming), because the more the software is modular, and the more it will be easy to be maintained, understood, developed, etc...


## Work in progress...

The project is still under a work in progress phase, so all guidelines may not be available yet and PRs may be not merged immediately, but feel free to starting contributing. We will love to review and accept your PRs.
