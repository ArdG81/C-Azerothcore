## Introduction

AzerothCore it is a team of developers that creates MMORPG games mainly based on C ++. To acquire or have access to our projects, you'll have to pay them. Our sources are inspired on TrinityCore, Mangos and ScriptDev2. We do over time changes to optimize, improve and clean the base of the codes while, at the same time we improve the game mechanics and the game functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
