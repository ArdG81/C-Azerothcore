## Introduction

AzerothCore it is a team of developers that creates MMORPG games mainly based on C ++. To acquire or have access to our projects, you'll have to pay them. Our sources are inspired on TrinityCore, Mangos and ScriptDev2. We do over time changes to optimize, improve and clean the base of the codes while, at the same time we improve the game mechanics and the game functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.

For more information about the project, visit our website at project [AzerothCore](http://www.azerothcore.org/)


## Why AzerothCore?

Our main goal is to create a playable game server, offering a fully working game experience. In short, we focus on the **user experience (UX)**.

Like MaNGOS and TrinityCore did in past, we like to write clean code and doing software development right, but **our main goal is to have fully working features**. In other terms, we always prefer proper solutions to problems, but we may accept "*hackfixes*" (when they do not affect the game stability) if a proper solution is not available yet.

We also believe in [software modularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming), because the more the software is modular, and the more it will be easy to be maintained, understood, developed, etc...
