We are renaming several methods from `lowerCamelCase` to `UpperCamelCase` to follow our [codestyle conventions](https://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/cpp-code-standards#naming-of-variables-and-functions)

### How to upgrade

If you are using any of those methods, simply rename it by changing the first letter of the method from lowercase to uppercase.

Example: `getAreaInfo` -> `GetAreaInfo`
