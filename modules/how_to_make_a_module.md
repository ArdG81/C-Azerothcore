# CREATE A NEW AZEROTHCORE MODULE

1) Read this page first:

http://www.azerothcore.org/wiki/Create-a-Module


2) Run the script `create_module.sh`:
- If you're on windows, execute it with Git Bash (right click on it and choose Git bash) if you have installed Git extensions
- If you're on linux, just run it with `bash create_module.sh` or with `./create_module.sh`

This script will create the base of your module, with a clean history, with README files, and configure your git repository (local config).


NOTE: You can also clone our skeleton-module manually, clean the history, and configure but you **should** use the script instead https://github.com/azerothcore/skeleton-module/


3) Share it with the community!

Join us on our discord, share it there, and push it to the module catalogue.
